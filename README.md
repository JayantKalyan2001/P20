# P20
Implemented a simulation of a multi-threaded bitwise simplex communication system between
two Windows using Qt 5 and C++
## Features of the Project
- Project consisted of implementing a bitwise simplex communication and a report
- Implemented a Send window as well as its corresponding Receive window
- Send window projected its userâ€™s input onto the Receive Window
- It was multi-threaded so that the inputted doodles were projected onto the
screen in real-time
- Instruction enums were passed in a bitwise fashion
- For more in-depth information please read my report on this project
